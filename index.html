            <p> Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in reducing child mortality in recent decades. Yet 1 child in every 33 still dies from a preventable or treatable cause – half of these are newborns. The children of Bangladesh also face malnutrition, child marriage, lack of education and more, risking their very lives and futures.
